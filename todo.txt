(note: pywsd may or may not be helpful, look at it as you desire)
(note: some methods from nltk -> wn should be useful) 

handle_data.py: 

LSA full method: write the full modified LSA method: that means building the matrix and performing SVD 

Lesk-score full method: calculate modified Lesk score for a word in a corpus (loop over all sentences, calculate ties to words in sentence, get an average)

corpus_transform: transform the corpus into the MWR (multiple-word representation)

filtering method: we want to treat words as potentially different meanings if and only if they have a high enough MSS (multiple-sense score)

recommendation engine (cosine similarity): compute cosine of the sense-vectors to see how similar they are

actual sense tagging: we should be able to match the sense of the word with the correct sense ID (in SenseEval) 

(potentially)
part_of_speech check: we can win easily for a couple of cases if we just check part of speech

word_net check: (use built-in word net sense disambiguation)
